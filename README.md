## ✨ About Me

Hi! I’m **Giulio**, AI engineer and educator. I program AI model with Python and now I dedicate my time to helping newcomers break into tech — faster and with fewer headaches than I had.

## 🌱 Why I Teach — *The Cause*

Learning to code changed my life. I believe **accessible, project‑based education** can do the same for anyone, regardless of background or budget. My mission is to:

1. **Demystify programming** through plain‑language explanations and hands‑on projects.
2. **Bridge theory and practice** so you can ship real value — not just pass quizzes.
3. **Foster community** where learners help learners, because teaching is the fastest way to level‑up.
